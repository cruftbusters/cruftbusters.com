      My plan is to extend Logbook to handle my accounting workflows. This could
      include small deliverable steps like:
      <ul>
        <li>multiple named books</li>
        <li>support for multiple currencies and resource types</li>
        <li>start and end date filter</li>
        <li>
          table summary with columns for intervals like yearly quarterly monthly
          weekly daily
        </li>
        <li>gauge (balance) visualizations </li>
        <li>
          counter (flow pnl) visualizations like sankey and timeseries bars
        </li>
        <li>local persistence</li>
        <li>sync with a self-hosted server</li>
        <li>validate non-statements against statements</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
