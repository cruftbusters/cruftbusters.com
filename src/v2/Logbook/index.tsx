        Logbook is for ad-hoc summarizations of transactions. Transactions could
        be financial. However Logbook supports units beyond money like hours or
        kilowatt hours or physical assets. Logbook is inspired by Datadog
        notebooks and rich ad-hoc reporting and monitoring for software
        telemetry.
